//--- Easy
//create a variable and assign it a number
let number = 10
//minus 10 from that number
number = number - 10
//print that number to the console
console.log(number)
//--- Medium
//create a variable that holds a value from the input
let input = document.querySelector('input').value
//add 25 to that number
input += 25
//alert that number
alert(input)
//--- Hard
//create a variable that holds the h1

//add an event listener to that element that console logs the sum of the two previous variables
